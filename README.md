## Screenshots (version 1.6)

Context menu can display the information in different ways. Use the Options page to change what click, Shift+Click and Ctrl+click (Mac: Command+Click) do.

If you choose to overlay the information onto the image, the details are more compact.

The overlay also is available for stand-alone images (images you open into the same or a new tab).
